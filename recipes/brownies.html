    <h1>Homemade Brownies</h1>

    <p><h2>Description</h2></p>
        <p>The BEST brownies recipe! With crispy edges, fudgy middles, and rich chocolate flavor, these homemade brownies will disappear in no time.</p>
        <p>For years, I couldn't seem to find a recipe for brownies that met my standards. Any time I made brownies, I wanted them to be just like the one 
            I had as a kid - super fudgy, moist, and chocolaty, with crispy edges and crackly tops. But the thing is, these brownies never had a recipe.
            They came in a box. Nowadays, I prefer to bake from scratch, but no brownie recipe I tried could live up to the chocolate brownies from my 
            childhood.
        </p>
        <p>So this fall, as I flipped through Michelle Lopez's new book, her recipe for Box Mix Brownies From Scratch caught my eye. Would I finally be able
            to make homemade brownies that would be just as delicious as the ones from a box? 
        </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>1 1/2 cups granulated sugar</ul>
            <ul>3/4 cup all purpose flour</ul>
            <ul>2/3 cup cocoa powder, sifted if lumpy</ul>
            <ul>1/2 cup powdered sugar, sifted if lumpy</ul>
            <ul>1/2 cup dark chocolate chips</ul>
            <ul>3/4 teaspoon sea salt</ul>
            <ul>2 large eggs</ul>
            <ul>1/2 cup canola oil</ul>
            <ul>2 tablespoons water</ul>
            <ul>1/2 teaspoon vanilla</ul>
        </p>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>
            <ol>1. Preheat the oven to 325 F. Lightly spray an 8x8 baking dish (not a 9x9 or your brownies will overcoook) with cooking spray and line it with 
                parchment paper.</ol>
            <ol>2. In a medium bowl, combine the sugar, flour, cocoa powder, powdered sugar, chocolate chips, and salt.</ol>
            <ol>3. In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, oil, water, and vanilla.</ol>
            <ol>4. Sprinkle the dry mix over the wet mix and stir until just combined.</ol>
            <ol>5. Pour the batter into the prepared pan (it'll be thick- that's okay) and use a spatula to smooth the top. Bake for 40 to 48 minutes, or until
                a toothpick comes out with only a few crumbs attached (note: it's better to pull the brownies out too early than leave them too long). 
                <strong>Cool completely before serving!</strong> Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to three days. These also freeze well!</ol>
