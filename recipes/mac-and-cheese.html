            <p>
                <ul>1 lb. dried elbow pasta</ul>
                <ul>1/2 cup unsalted butter</ul>
                <ul>1/2 cup all purpose flour</ul>
                <ul>1 1/2 cups whole milk</ul>
                <ul>2 1/2 cups half and half</ul>
                <ul>4 cups shredded medium sharp cheddar cheese <em>divided (measured after shredding)</em></ul>
                <ul>2 cups shredded Gruyere cheese <em>divided (measured after shredding)</em></ul>
                <ul>1/2 Tbsp. salt</ul>
                <ul>1/2 tsp. black pepper</ul>
                <ul>1/4 tsp. paprika</ul>
            </p>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <p>
                <ol>1. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F and grease a 3 quart baking dish (9x13"). Set aside.</ol>
                <ol>2. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. When boiling, add dried pasta and cook 1 minute less than the package directs for al dente.
                    Drain and drizzle with a little bit of olive oil to keep from sticking.</ol>
                 <ol>3. While water is coming to a boil, shred cheeses and toss together to mix, then divide into three piles. Approximately 3 cups for the sauce,
                    1 1/2 cups for the inner layer, and 1 1/2 cups for the topping.</ol>
                <ol>4. Melt butter in a large saucepan over MED heat. Sprinkle in flour and whisk to combine. Mixture will look like very wet sand. Cook for
                    approximately one minute, whisking constantly. Slowly pour in about 2 cups of the half and half, while whisking constantly, until smooth.
                    Slowly pour in the remaining half and half and the whole milk, while whisking constantly, until combined and smooth.</ol>
                <ol>5. Continue to heat over MED heat, whisking very often, until thickened.</ol>
                <ol>6. Remove from heat and stir in spice and 1 1/2 cups of cheeses, stirring to melt and combine. Stir in another 1 1/2 cup of cheeses, stirring
                    until completely melted and smooth.</ol>
                <ol>7. In a large mixing bowl, combine drained pasta with cheese sauce, stirring to combine fully. Pour half of the pasta mixture into the prepared
                    baking dish. Top with 1 1/2 cups of shredded cheeses, then top that with remaining pasta mixture.</ol>
                <ol>8. Sprinkle top with last 1 1/2 cups of cheese and bake for 15 minutes, until cheese is bubbly and lightly golden brown.</ol>
